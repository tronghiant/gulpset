# Welcome ðŸ¤—

You are now viewing the styleguide page generated by Docz.

Docz uses MDX format (Markdown + JSX) to write demos on how to use components of a project.

A simple demonstration of writing in MDX:

```
import { Component } from '../components/component'
import { Playground, PropsTable } from 'docz'

# Component

<PropsTable of={Component} />

<Playground>
  <Component />
</Playground>
```

ðŸ‘‰ For more information on MDX and its features, please visit: https://github.com/mdx-js/mdx.

## ðŸ’¡How to use this styleguide

### 1. List of Components

On the left side of the screen there is a menu bar showing a list of components where you
can navigate to the styleguide page of each individual component. You can also use to
Search feature to find the component you are looking for.

### 2. Component page

Each component page has 2 main sections. The PropsTable section is where all the props of a
component are displayed with necessary information:

- Property name
- Type
- Required or not
- Default value

The Demo section shows how a component actually looks like in a website and its variations
(if any). It is possible to view the JSX and HTML code by clicking the `<>` button.
